## Background
Art, in its various forms, has always played a significant role in human civilization, offering profound insights, emotional experiences, and cultural reflections. However, recent developments suggest a decline in the appreciation of art, which warrants our attention. It emphasizes the need for society to recognize the value of art and actively support artists to ensure their continued growth and artistic expression. People are experiencing a significant gap in their understanding of artistic concepts, art history, and cultural appreciation. It can result in a generation with limited appreciation for art and its profound impact on society. Our team has recognized three key issues that hinder the growth and development of art appreciation and understanding in our country. It is so ironic that even Effendi says “There is no country in the world which has cultural heritage as rich as Indonesia”.
